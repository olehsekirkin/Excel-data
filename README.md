# Excel-data
Interactive Excel dashboard created from a dataset.

## Description

Project to showcase and remember some Excel functions, the dataset is "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx" and includes 3 differente worksheets: orders, customers and products.

Orders worksheet includes: Order ID, Order Date, Customer ID, Quantity.
Customers worksheet includes: Customer ID, Customer Name, Email, Phone Number, Address Line 1, City, Country, Postcode, Loyalty Card.
Products worksheet includes: Product ID, Coffee Type, Size, Unit Price, Price per 100g, Profit.

With the dataset already created, I just had to clean non valid data (some empty cells) and duplicated data, create new useful values (Coffee Type, Roast Type, etc. for each Order ID) that provide deeper information and visuals to present the final result with the interactive Dashboard that you can find at "CoffeeDashboard.xlsx"
